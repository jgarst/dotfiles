#! /usr/bin/env sh

# This pattern and command is taken from emilyst's dotfiles 
# https://github.com/emilyst/home

# Maintaining dotfiles in a git repo is a great idea, but support for the XDG
# spec is too intermittent and fragile to rely on.  This script helps me keep
# the entire home directory as a git repo.

# To prevent git aware tools from interpreting all my files as project files
# `home` uses an obfuscated git repo.
git --work-tree="${HOME}" --git-dir="${HOME}/home.git" "$@"

# This also semantically separates maintaining my dotfiles from programming

# The `home` gitignore requires more workarounds for this workaround to work.
