.. _atuin-site: https://github.com/ellie/atuin

Atuin
=====
`Atuin <atuin-site_>`__ is utility that replaces the shell history text file
with a sqlite database.
I have reservations about moving away from plain text, but sqlite seems stable
enough, I have had some problems with corruption of the history file, and I
don't expect to have anything else consume the history file.
I am not using Atuin's ability to sync history between machines, as I do not yet
trust it's ability to keep safe any passwords I accidentally enter into history.

Bound to ``Ctrl - r`` and ``â†‘`` in the command prompt.


.. _mpv-site: https://mpv.io/

mpv
===
`mpv <mpv-site_>`__ is my preferred video player, and enabled gpu acceleration
by default.
This is officially unwise, but in practice my inputs are basically always
trusted, and my older machines are struggling to play videos without it.

Aliased to ``video``.


.. _htop-site: https://htop.dev/

htop
====
`htop <htop-site_>`__ is an old reliable for inquires about resources, and seems
to have found new maintainers.

Aliased to ``top``.


.. _dust-site: https://github.com/bootandy/dust

dust
====
`dust <dust-site_>`__ is a command line utility to present disk usage.
I find it more usable than du.

Aliased to ``du``.


tsc
===

..
    I avoid aliasing my repl to py because Brett Cannon has claimed the name
    for his Python launcher.  https://github.com/brettcannon/python-launcher

.. _ptpython-site: https://github.com/prompt-toolkit/ptpython

ptpython
========
`ptpython <ptpython-site_>`__ combines prompt toolkit and jedi to create a
nicer Python REPL.

Aliased to ``pyr``.


.. _black-site: https://github.com/psf/black

black
=====
`black <black-site_>`__ is an opinionated python formatter.
Though I am happy to commit to using standard black for public projects, I am
unduly annoyed by the line limit of 88, and have set it to 80 by default for my
personal projects, most of which are throw away.

Vim formats on write with black.
