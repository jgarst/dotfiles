# set by alacritty it self.
# env:
# TERM env customization. Default is xterm-256color
# Note: the default TERM value `xterm-256color` does not
# specify all features alacritty supports. This does pose
# a few issues with programs relying on terminfo and the
# `tput` command
# TERM: xterm-256color

# Visual Bell
#
# Any time the BEL code is received, Alacritty "rings" the visual bell. Once
# rung, the terminal background will be set to white and transition back to the
# default background color. You can control the rate of this transition by
# setting the `duration` property (represented in milliseconds). You can also
# configure the transition function by setting the `animation` property.
#
# Possible values for `animation`
# `Ease`
# `EaseOut`
# `EaseOutSine`
# `EaseOutQuad`
# `EaseOutCubic`
# `EaseOutQuart`
# `EaseOutQuint`
# `EaseOutExpo`
# `EaseOutCirc`
# `Linear`
#
# To completely disable the visual bell, set its duration to 0.

# Key bindings
#
# Each binding is defined as an object with some properties. Most of the
# properties are optional. All of the alphabetical keys should have a letter for
# the `key` value such as `V`. Function keys are probably what you would expect
# as well (F1, F2, ..). The number keys above the main keyboard are encoded as
# `Key1`, `Key2`, etc. Keys on the number pad are encoded `Number1`, `Number2`,
# etc.  These all match the glutin::VirtualKeyCode variants.
#
# Possible values for `mods`
# `Command`, `Super` refer to the super/command/windows key
# `Control` for the control key
# `Shift` for the Shift key
# `Alt` and `Option` refer to alt/option
#
# mods may be combined with a `|`. For example, requiring control and shift
# looks like:
#
# mods: Control|Shift
#
# The parser is currently quite sensitive to whitespace and capitalization -
# capitalization must match exactly, and piped items must not have whitespace
# around them.
#
# Either an `action` or `chars` field must be present. `chars` writes the
# specified string every time that binding is activated. These should generally
# be escape sequences, but they can be configured to send arbitrary strings of
# bytes. Possible values of `action` include `Paste` and `PasteSelection`.
#
# Want to add a binding (e.g. "PageUp") but are unsure what the X sequence
# (e.g. "\x1b[5~") is? Open another terminal (like xterm) without tmux,
# then run `showkey -a` to get the sequence associated to a key combination.
