Dotfiles
========

This is a record of Jared's personal configuration files.  They come with some important caveats.

1) I am more interested in recording all my choices than in making a coherent system.
    My goal is to record every special feature of my development environment in this repo.
    Sometimes recording these choices is tricky configuration options is tricky, because theIt is important to me that I can record all the settings I adjust

    are not built for ease of use by other people.  If you see something in the files that you are interested in, I would suggest emailing me directly.


Color Scheme
============
I am using the [Tomorrow Night theme](https://github.com/ChrisKempson/Tomorrow-Theme) and its variations. More specifically
* Tomorrow Night Bright for terminals and text editors.
* Tomorrow Night Blue for focused window manager components.
* Tomorrow Night for focused but inactive window manager components, for example the focused window on an inactive monitor screen.
* Tomorrow Night Eighties for unfocused window manager components.
